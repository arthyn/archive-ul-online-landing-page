#UL Online Degree Landing Page

This project's main purpose was to be a 508 compliant highly performant landing page to promote University of Louisiana at Lafayette's online degree program. I did this project at BBR Creative. It was the first time I had a hard accessibility requirement so I learned quite a lot, especially testing with a screen reader.
